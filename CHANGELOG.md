## [1.1.0](https://github.com/saibotsivad/jmap-fetch-test-email/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0) - 2022-10-04
### Added
- Following news that Fastmail changed their API endpoints (from `jmap.fastmail.com` to `api.fastmail.com`) and authentication mechanism (from `Basic` to `Bearer`), I updated this library to support either. (Both are supported.)
- Added a log on retry, so it's clearer that something is happening.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/saibotsivad/jmap-fetch-test-email/tree/v1.0.0) - 2021-05-26
### Added
- Basic functionality added, with documentation in the readme.
